## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Remove support for major node versions 14,15,17,19. Minimum Node.js version is now 16. ([#188](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-trezor-keyring/pull/188))
- Bump `@metamask/eth-sig-util` from `^5.0.2` to `^7.0.0` ([#189](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-trezor-keyring/pull/189))
- Bump dependency `hdkey` from `0.8.0` to `^2.1.0` ([#190](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-trezor-keyring/pull/190))

## [2.0.0]
### Added
- Add `destroy` method to `TrezorKeyring`, which replaces `dispose` ([#179](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-trezor-keyring/pull/179))

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Separate the bridge from the keyring ([#143](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-trezor-keyring/pull/143))
  - The Trezor bridge is now a separate class (`TrezorConnectBridge`), which must be constructed separately from the keyring and passed in as a constructor argument.
  - The bridge initialization has been moved from the keyring constructor to the keyring `init` method. The bridge is expected to be passed to the keyring uninitialized, and the keyring `init` method is expected to be called after keyring construction (before the keyring is used).
  - The keyring constructor no longer accepts keyring state. Instead, any pre-existing keyring state should be passed to the `deserialize` method after construction.

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Remove `dispose` method from `TrezorKeyring`, which is replaced by `destroy` ([#179](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-trezor-keyring/pull/179))
